# 1) Human Emotion Recognition 
This project focuses on Human Emotion Recognition by analyzing facial expressions using machine learning and deep learning techniques.
The model predicts emotions such as Happy or Angry from images of human faces.
The goal of this project is to build an end-to-end emotion recognition system including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
